    "Over the three weeks of Module 2 we will be working on a small project to put our new skills into practice as we build them through the daily lectures and practice exercises.  Please read through the [project description](https://github.com/summercomputinginstitute/demo_notebooks/blob/main/project_description.md) before completing this Project Proposal.  Once you have read the instructions and selected a topic, complete the below questions from CRISP-DM Steps 1 & 2 for your chosen topic, and submit it via GitHub Classroom by pushing it back to your repo.  This proposal will be graded only as pass/fail - the purpose is for you to think through the details of how to frame your project topic in a way that is manageable to tackle."

Due to a combination of factors like industrial plants, and vehicle combustion, soil acidity and acidic depositions are very high in this region. Normally, soil is only slighly acidic  (pH > 6.5) but due to the lack of limsetone in the northeastern part of US like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, soil cannot neutralize acidic depositions and the pH drops below the normal, which affects crop yield."

    "The impact of acidity in soil is very broad and insidiuous. I would like to visualize the effect of  pH level on plant growth,  and  how the effects of acidity can be neutralized by introducing lime to acidic soil.If the soil is rich in limestone or if the underlying bedrock is either composed of limestone or marble, then the acidity may be neutralised. This is because limestone and marble are more alkaline (basic) and produce a higher pH when dissolved in water."

It sounds obvious, but one of the most effective ways to help restore the areas damaged by acidity is to cut the emission of sulfur and nitrous oxides from the most heavily-polluting industries.
